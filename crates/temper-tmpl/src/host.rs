//! A library's host code: the files of backend code beside its modules
//! (`__connected__.py`, `_connected.rs`, `Counter.java`, …) that
//! implement its own `@connected` functions and classes, and which of
//! those each backend takes from host code rather than from their Temper
//! implementations, as Kotlin Temper's `ConnectedChoice.kt` decides
//! (notes/tmpl/names.md, "Connected declarations").
//!
//! - A connected declaration without a Temper implementation (a bodiless
//!   function) always uses host code.
//! - With one, `--no-connected` ([`Host::no_connected`]) uses it on every
//!   backend; otherwise a declaration that lists no backends uses host
//!   code everywhere, and one that lists some uses it on those, and its
//!   Temper implementation elsewhere.
//!
//! As in Kotlin, the choice doesn't look at which files are there: a
//! listed backend whose host code is missing fails in its own compiler or
//! at its first call. Core's and std's connected declarations resolve by
//! qname ([`crate::qname::resolves_by_qname`]) and aren't affected.
//!
//! Host files are given by the build, beside the program; tmpl's text form
//! doesn't carry them.
