//! The naming pass: every declaration of the program's own gets an output
//! name, pretty and numbered only to resolve a real conflict
//! (notes/tmpl/names.md, "The naming pass"; design.md section 8).
//!
//! For function-scoped targets, a function's parameters and locals share one scope, as
//! Python's do, and two of them may share a name when neither is alive
//! while the other is (and, where the target's checkers want it, as
//! Python's, when they have the same type, with or without null). For
//! block-scoped targets without shadowing (JS's
//! `let` and `const`, [`NamingRules::block_scoped`]), two may share a name
//! only when declared in blocks that don't nest. The init block's locals live in the module's
//! scope, as Python's module-level code does. Labels and other
//! libraries' declarations get no name: labels aren't printed by
//! function-scoped targets so far, and external declarations are named by
//! their own library or their variant's connection table.
