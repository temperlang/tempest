//! The schema: one table declaring every node kind, its family, where its
//! type comes from, and its fields, from which `schema!` generates
//! [`Kind`], its metadata, and [`Node`] with [`Nodes::get`].
//!
//! Each field says where it's stored:
//!
//! - `a` or `b`: a payload slot, holding an id or a literal's bits;
//!   `ab`: both, for 64-bit literals;
//! - `flag`: the node's [`Flags::MAY_BUBBLE`] bit;
//! - `one`, `opt`, or `many`, then a [`Place`]: children, in order. A kind
//!   has at most one `opt` or `many` field, which takes the children that
//!   the `one` fields leave.
//!
//! Subset A (notes/tmpl/nodes.md, Level 3), with what core's declarations
//! need: `CallMethod`, `Omitted`, and bodiless (connected) functions; and
//! from subset B, classes and interfaces with their members, `this`,
//! fields, statics, `new`, conversions, `is`, and identity; and function
//! values: literals with their captures, references, calls of values, and
//! the conversions between `@fun` interfaces and function types; and
//! `Coalesce`, for parameters' defaults.
