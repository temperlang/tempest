//! tmpl, Temper's backend IR: a settled, typed, fully explicit program
//! that a backend can translate without asking anything of the frontend
//! (notes/tmpl/README.md).
//!
//! This crate depends only on `temper-os`, for the processes its tools
//! start, and never lists backends:
//!
//! - [`Backend`], what tools need of a backend, and [`OutFile`]; with
//!   [`Tools`], how a backend's language runs tests, natively, which
//!   [`tools`]'s helpers (tool lookup, commands, and JUnit XML) serve;
//! - [`Program`], with its tables: [`Nodes`], [`TypeTable`],
//!   [`DeclTable`], and [`Strings`];
//! - [`schema`], one table declaring every node kind, from which
//!   [`Kind`] and [`Node`] are generated;
//! - [`Builder`], for constructing programs;
//! - [`text`], the canonical text form, which reads back exactly;
//! - [`validate()`](mod@validate), the validator's rules, each problem
//!   with its code;
//! - [`ops`], the operator table;
//! - [`qname`], qualified names in Kotlin's format, and how connected
//!   declarations resolve;
//! - [`naming`], the naming pass, which gives each declaration a pretty
//!   output name by a target's [`naming::NamingRules`];
//! - [`analysis`], analyses that passes and backends share;
//! - [`host`], a library's host code, and which connected declarations
//!   each backend takes from it;
//! - [`source_map`], Source Map v3 files from spans, for backends;
//! - shared lowerings that backends pick by their profiles:
//!   [`coroutines`], [`errors`], [`spill`], and [`switches`];
//! - [`version`], Temper's version and its spelling in each ecosystem.
