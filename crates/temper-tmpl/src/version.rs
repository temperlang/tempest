//! Temper's version: one canonical version, the workspace's
//! (`[workspace.package] version` in the root `Cargo.toml`), with a stage
//! and a count of commits from git, spelled for each ecosystem so that
//! dev builds, pre-releases, and releases sort the same way in all of
//! them (docs/internals/detail/06-backends.md, "Versions").
//!
//! | Stage | SemVer (npm, Cargo, NuGet, Maven, vcpkg, Conan) | Python | LuaRocks |
//! | --- | --- | --- | --- |
//! | dev build | `0.7.0-alpha.0.123` | `0.7.0.dev123` | `0.7.0.alpha.0.123-1` |
//! | alpha 1 | `0.7.0-alpha.1` | `0.7.0a1` | `0.7.0.alpha.1-1` |
//! | alpha 1 plus 5 | `0.7.0-alpha.1.5` | `0.7.0a2.dev5` | `0.7.0.alpha.1.5-1` |
//! | beta, rc | `-beta.1`, `-rc.1` (plus `.5`) | `b1`, `rc1` (`b2.dev5`) | `.beta.1-1`, `.rc.1-1` |
//! | release | `0.7.0` | `0.7.0` | `0.7.0-1` |
//! | dev after it | `0.7.1-alpha.0.5` | `0.7.1.dev5` | `0.7.1.alpha.0.5-1` |
//!
//! Go adds `v` to the SemVer spelling; CMake takes only the numbers.
//!
//! This file uses nothing but std, as `temper-driver`'s build script
//! includes it too, to name the build's version from git.
