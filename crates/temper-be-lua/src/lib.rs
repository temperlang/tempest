//! Temper's Lua backend: tmpl in, Lua out.
//!
//! Works from tmpl alone (notes/tmpl/overview.md, "Boundaries"). Its
//! variants share the translation and differ only in data
//! (notes/tmpl/profiles.md, "Variants and the first profiles"); the first,
//! [`LUA`], is Kotlin-compatible: the same layout (`LIBRARY/init.lua`, the
//! library's root module, which `require("LIBRARY")` loads with Kotlin's
//! `LUA_PATH` of `?.lua;?/init.lua`, and a LuaRocks rockspec beside it),
//! the same exports (a table of the library's exported names, which the
//! chunk returns), names, and `temper-core` runtime, required as
//! `temper-core`, as Kotlin Temper's `lua` backend, with prettier bodies:
//! no numbered names, local functions and locals declared where they're
//! first given a value, `..` for concatenation, `print` for logging,
//! natural control flow, with `goto` only for `continue` and jumps out of
//! inner loops, and blank lines between functions. LuaCATS annotations
//! (`---@param i integer`) type parameters, results, and locals declared
//! without a value, for LuaLS's checker.
//!
//! Classes and interfaces are the runtime's types, `temper.type`, as
//! Kotlin's ([`classes`]): `r.area` reads a getter, `r:scaled(2)` calls a
//! method, and `Rect.unit` is a static.
//!
//! Null is the runtime's `temper.null`, as Kotlin's, since Lua's `nil`
//! can't be a table's value or tell an argument left out, checked by
//! `temper.is_null`, which takes `nil` too; nullable types are
//! `T|temper.Null` for LuaLS. `orelse` is Kotlin's `temper.pcall` of a
//! function, which an `if` then follows with the fallback (and redoes
//! a jump out of the body, which returns a signal saying which), and
//! `bubble()` the runtime's error. What Lua can't write inline (`orelse`,
//! statements before a value, as `??` makes, and `if` values that Lua's
//! `and` and `or` can't choose) goes before its statement
//! ([`translate`], "Hoisting").
//!
//! Generics are Lua's own: core's lists are tables (`{ 1, 2 }`), maps
//! and pairs the runtime's, as Kotlin's, with `---@generic` for a
//! generic function, `T[]`, `table<K, V>`, and `{ key: K, value: V }` for
//! LuaLS, and `any` for a generic class's type parameters, which LuaLS's
//! classes don't take.
//!
//! Where Kotlin's isn't right, it differs ([`translate`], [`classes`]):
//! exported `var`s that functions or methods write stay current in the
//! exports table, Lua's keyword `goto` is reserved, `Boolean`'s `<` is
//! logic, where Kotlin's compares booleans, which Lua can't, a type's
//! runtime name is qualified by its module, so `is` doesn't take one
//! module's `Point` for another's, a static can't replace the runtime's
//! keys of its type, and a plain `toString()` is also `__tostring`.
//!
//! The pipeline: the naming pass ([`temper_tmpl::naming::assign`]) with
//! Lua's rules ([`names::RULES`]), then [`translate`] into Lua's output
//! tree ([`tree`]), with operators spelled by [`ops`] and core's connected
//! declarations by [`connected`], then the printer.
