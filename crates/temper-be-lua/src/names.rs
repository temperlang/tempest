//! Lua's `NamingRules`, for the first variant (notes/tmpl/names.md,
//! "`NamingRules`"): names keep their case, as Kotlin Temper's Lua backend
//! keeps them (`halfAndHalf`); Lua's keywords and the names the translator
//! prints take a trailing `_`, as Kotlin's keywords do; characters Lua
//! doesn't allow in a name (anything but ASCII letters, digits, and `_`)
//! become `_` and their hex code; and locals are block-scoped without
//! shadowing, as `local` is block-scoped.
