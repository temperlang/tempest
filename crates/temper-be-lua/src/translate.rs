//! The translation from tmpl to Lua's output tree, for subsets A and B
//! (classes and interfaces, in [`crate::classes`]).
//!
//! A module is a chunk that runs once, when it's first `require`d, as
//! Kotlin's, and returns its exports in a table. Its functions are local
//! functions, and its module `let`s and `var`s locals of the chunk, which
//! functions refer to as upvalues. Lua resolves a name where it's read, to
//! the innermost local declared before it in the text, so the chunk is
//! laid out as:
//!
//! 1. `local temper = require("temper-core")`, if it uses the runtime;
//! 2. `local exports = {}`, if an exported `var` is written by functions
//!    (below);
//! 3. module `let`s and `var`s that functions or members use, or that the
//!    init block doesn't initialize at its top level, declared with their
//!    type (`---@type integer`) and no value
//!    ([`module_state`]);
//! 4. functions and types referred to before they're defined, declared
//!    together (`local f, g`), and then defined without `local`;
//! 5. `with_tostring`, if a class uses it, then the functions and types, in
//!    source order, but each type after its supertypes, whose members
//!    making it copies;
//! 6. the init block, where a module `let` or `var` initialized at its top
//!    level, and not declared before, is declared with its value, and
//!    static fields are set on their types' tables;
//! 7. the exports, `return { … }`.
//!
//! **Exported `var`s that functions or members write** live in the
//! exports table itself (`exports.total`), so a library's users see their
//! current value. Kotlin's copies every export into the table once, after
//! the init block, so such a `var` stays at its first value for users. A
//! type's statics are its table's, which the exports share, so they're
//! current too.
//!
//! **Modules and imports:** each module is a chunk of its own, required
//! by its path (`lib/helpers/deep`, the root module by the library's
//! name), as Kotlin's. A module's functions, `let`s, and types used from
//! another are locals there, `local greet = require('lib/helpers/deep').greet`;
//! its `var`s are read where they're used, from its exports table, so
//! the read is current. Tests go in a file of their own
//! ([`Translator::tests`]), which reaches what its module doesn't export,
//! and the `var`s its tests assign, through a table its module adds to
//! its exports for them, under `'$test'`. The root module requires the
//! library's other modules that it doesn't import, so requiring the
//! library runs them all, as Kotlin's Python and JS do, but for those
//! that import the root, directly or not, whose `require` would recurse.
//!
//! **Lua's limit on locals:** a function, the chunk included, may have at
//! most 200 locals alive at once. Past 128 module-level locals (Kotlin's
//! threshold), the module's functions and module `let`s after its first
//! 100 are fields of a `module` table instead, as Kotlin's keeps its first
//! 100 and puts the rest in a table (`env_t1`); a function with more than
//! 200 locals alive at once is not yet.
//!
//! **Jumps:** `break` is Lua's own for the innermost loop. A `continue` is
//! `goto continue`, to a label ending the loop's body (`::continue::`),
//! which runs a `repeat`'s condition, as Temper's `do … while` does; a
//! jump from an inner loop to an outer one is a `goto` to a label named
//! for the loop, ending its body (`continue_outer`) or after it
//! (`break_outer`). Labels are printed only where a jump needs one, and
//! `goto` needs Lua 5.2 or later, or LuaJIT, as Kotlin's output does.
//!
//! **Hoisting:** what Lua can't write inline goes before the statement
//! it's in, leaving a temporary (`t`, `t_1`, …, named unlike anything
//! the program names): an `orelse`, as `---@type T local t` and `if not
//! temper.pcall(function() t = body end) then t = fallback end`, as
//! Kotlin's, or straight into the local or module `let` it initializes;
//! a `BlockValue`'s statements, in place; and an `if` value, `&&`, or
//! `||` that has such a part where it runs only sometimes, or an `if`
//! value that `and` and `or` can't choose, as an `if` statement. What
//! runs before the hoisted part in Temper's order must have no effects,
//! and a loop's condition hoists nothing; otherwise it's not yet. An
//! `orelse`'s body is a function of its own, so a `return`, `break`, or
//! `continue` out of it returns a signal that an `if` after the
//! `temper.pcall` redoes, as Kotlin's ([`TryBody`]).
//!
//! **Order of evaluation:** Lua evaluates operands and arguments left to
//! right (its reference implementation and LuaJIT; the manual leaves only
//! multiple assignment's order open, which this never prints), so Temper's
//! order needs no temporaries. Where Lua's `and` and `or` would skip an
//! operand that Temper evaluates (an `if` value's spelling, `c and a or
//! b`, and `Boolean`'s order, `not a and b`), the translator checks with
//! [`Effects`] that skipping or repeating it can't show, and otherwise
//! spells it another way.
