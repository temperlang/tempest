//! Static types, the first slice of milestone 4 (notes/history/milestone-4.md):
//! declared and inferred types of declarations as facts in the settle
//! loop, and the type errors Kotlin Temper reports for literals, locals,
//! parameters, calls of known functions, conditions and returns.
//!
//! Typing starts once expansion has settled, as a second round of the
//! loop: each declaration whose type comes from its initializer, as `let
//! x = f(1)`, is a work item that publishes [`Fact::Type`] once it knows
//! that type, waiting on the declarations its initializer reads. Declared
//! types, parameters' and functions' signatures need no waiting: they come
//! from annotations. A cycle, as `let a = b; let b = a`, is forced, leaving
//! the type unknown. Then a pass over each file checks what it can. Macros
//! that need types will interleave with this once there are some.
//!
//! An unknown type never causes an error, so what isn't typed yet, such as
//! function literals' types, just goes unchecked. Builtin operators' and
//! `console.log`'s signatures are in [`signatures`], builtin types'
//! members', read from core, in
//! [`core_members`], what may bubble where it can't, in [`bubbles`],
//! classes' and their members' types, in [`members`], named `@fun`
//! interfaces' rules, nominal, in [`fun_interfaces`], run-time type
//! checks' errors, in [`rtti`], generic functions' calls, solved per
//! call, in [`generic_calls`], and the type a value's place wants, which
//! types list literals, in [`targets`], and decides object literals'
//! classes, in [`object_literals`], and which `@overload` method a call
//! means, in [`overloads`], or which `@extension` function, in
//! [`instance_extensions`]. Before
//! inferring, flow facts ([`crate::flow`]) find the uses of locals that
//! null checks and `is` checks narrow, so typing a use of `a: String?`
//! after `if (a != null)` gives `String`, and of `i: I` after `if (i is
//! D)`, `D`.
