//! The core constructs that macros reduce everything to
//! (notes/milestone-3.md), as node kinds of the shared tree, with their
//! layouts:
//!
//! | Kind | Children | Data |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `Block` | statements; its value is the last one's | |
//! | `If` | condition, then, else (an empty block if none) | |
//! | `Loop` | body, then `next` if any, run after the body and on `continue` | [`LOOP_NEXT`], [`LOOP_EACH`] |
//! | `Break`, `Continue` | | the target `Block` or `Loop`, or for `continue` in `for … of`, its body `Fn` |
//! | `Return` | value | the `Fn` |
//! | `Yield` | value (null for a bare `yield`) | the generator `Fn` |
//! | `Await` | promise | the generator `Fn` (an `async` block's) |
//! | `Orelse` | body, fallback | |
//! | `Fail` | | |
//! | `Fn` | type parameters, parameters (each a `Let`), return type if any, supertypes, body unless [`FN_NO_BODY`] | parameter count, supertype count << [`FN_SUPERS_SHIFT`], type parameter count << [`TYPE_PARAMS_SHIFT`], [`FN_OUT_TYPE`], [`FN_LOOP_BODY`], [`FN_NO_BODY`] |
//! | `Let` | `LeftName`, type if any, initial value if any | [`LET_VAR`], [`LET_TYPE`], [`LET_INIT`] |
//! | `Assign` | `RightName` or `obj.name` (a `.` call), value | |
//! | `Call` | callee, arguments, with type arguments as `\typeArg T` pairs | |
//! | `Class` | `LeftName`, type parameters, supertypes, members (each a `Let`) | supertype count, type parameter count << [`TYPE_PARAMS_SHIFT`], [`CLASS_INTERFACE`], [`CLASS_AUTO_EQ`], [`CLASS_FUN`] |
//!
//! Plus names (`RightName` resolved to a symbol), `Value` and `Error`.
//!
//! A member is a `Let` whose data also has a role ([`ROLE_MASK`]) and maybe
//! a visibility ([`MEMBER_PUBLIC`], [`MEMBER_PROTECTED`] or
//! [`MEMBER_PRIVATE`], none if not given), [`MEMBER_STATIC`], [`MEMBER_CONNECTED`]
//! and [`MEMBER_OPERATOR_EQ`] or [`MEMBER_OPERATOR_CMP`]. A field's value
//! is its initializer, and a method's,
//! getter's, setter's or constructor's is its `Fn`, without a body
//! ([`FN_NO_BODY`]) if abstract or implemented outside Temper
//! ([`MEMBER_CONNECTED`]); [`member_fn`] gives only one with a body.
//!
//! A type parameter is a `Let` with the role [`ROLE_TYPE_PARAM`], whose
//! type, if any, is its bound (`T extends Bound`).
