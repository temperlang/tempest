//! A library settled a round at a time, as a REPL session grows: each
//! round settles only what was added since the last, against what's
//! settled already, and earlier rounds are never settled or typed again.
//!
//! That works because the settle loop's facts are monotonic: a resolved
//! name never changes, and neither does a type once known. A REPL's
//! inputs are files of one module, each with a scope of its own, a
//! *segment*, whose parent is the previous input's, so a lookup walks
//! back through earlier inputs, and a later declaration of a name
//! shadows an earlier one for later inputs only. Modules that inputs
//! import, from std or the work root, are ordinary modules, settled in
//! the round that loads them.
