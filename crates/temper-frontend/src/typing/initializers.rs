//! A local declared without a type or a value, as `var nc;`, takes its
//! type from its initializers, as Kotlin Temper's `TyperPlan` does: the
//! assignments to it that no other assignment to it comes before along
//! any path from the declaration (ignoring loops' back edges). Their
//! types' join is its type, so `let d; if (c) { d = f() } else { d = null
//! }` is `f()`'s type, nullable. Assignments in other functions, which
//! may run at any time, don't count.
