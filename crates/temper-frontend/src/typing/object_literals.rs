//! Object literals' classes from the type wanted (notes/typing.md,
//! "Object literals and target typing"; design.md, "Object literals, not
//! named arguments"). An object literal without `class: C`, `{ a: 1, b }`,
//! keeps its `\a` markers through expansion, while its values settle, and
//! is a work item of typing's round that waits for the type its place
//! wants ([`Settle::wanted_type`]), or for knowing there's none, and then
//! decides its class, by that type and by the names given together, and
//! becomes a constructor call with its arguments placed
//! ([`Settle::place_literal`]), publishing [`Fact::ObjectLiteral`]. Its
//! type, and the types its values' places want, wait for that fact.
