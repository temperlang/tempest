//! A REPL session: Temper inputs settled and run one at a time against
//! what earlier inputs declared, for `tempest repl`, and later the
//! playground's console and the language server.
//!
//! - **One growing library.** Each input is a file of one module, with a
//!   scope of its own chained to the previous input's, so later inputs
//!   see earlier names directly, and a later declaration shadows an
//!   earlier one: code that already resolved to the old one keeps it.
//!   Each input is settled and typed once, incrementally
//!   ([`Incremental`]); a top-level `let` is visible from its end, so
//!   `let s = "${s}!"` reads the earlier `s`, and a top-level `var`
//!   can be assigned from later inputs, checked against its type.
//! - **One interpreter** whose globals grow by each input
//!   ([`crate::interp::repl`]): code lowered once stays lowered, and
//!   `async` blocks waiting on promises stay parked until a later input
//!   resolves them. An input may `await` at its top level.
//! - **Errors never end a session.** An input with errors still settles
//!   and runs as far as it can, as libraries do; a declaration whose
//!   input failed stays declared, and a read of it fails saying why. A
//!   panic in tempest itself is caught and reported, and the session
//!   goes on. An interrupt, as from Ctrl-C, stops the input running.
//!
//! Each input reports, in order, its diagnostics, what it logs as it
//! runs, why it failed if no diagnostic says, and its result, as
//! [`ReplEvent`]s; [`ReplEvent::text`] gives each as `tempest repl`
//! prints it, the result in Kotlin's form, `interactive#N: value`.
//! [`Chunker`] splits typed or piped lines into inputs.
//!
//! The REPL's own functions, `help`, `describe`, and `translate`, are
//! declared before the first input ([`specials`]).
//!
//! What the REPL prints of its own, diagnostics, failures, and its
//! functions' output, has control characters escaped
//! ([`escape_controls`]), so it can't move the cursor, recolor the
//! terminal, or reorder text; a value's strings are quoted, escaped as
//! Temper's are. What an input logs is printed as it's logged.
