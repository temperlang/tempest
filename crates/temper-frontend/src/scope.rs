//! Scopes and symbols, and looking names up in them.
//!
//! Names are kept simple (notes/milestone-3.md, "Names"): a name's text is
//! an interned `NameId`; resolution is a side table from each use node to a
//! [`SymbolId`]; and symbols are one flat table of plain structs. Macros
//! that mean a particular builtin insert a name already resolved to its
//! symbol, so user declarations can't capture it. A temporary name from the
//! syntax step (never interned) gets a synthetic symbol when it's declared.
//!
//! A scope is complete once every declaration in it is known: for a
//! block, once each of its statements has had its macro expanded, as far as
//! needed to see whether it declares something. A lookup that reaches an
//! incomplete scope without finding its name waits for that scope to
//! complete, so a name never resolves outward past a declaration that's
//! still to come. The exception is a statement's own macro name, looked up
//! while its block is still being read: it sees the declarations before it
//! (see [`Lookup`]).
