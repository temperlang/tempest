//! One arena per library build: every file's tree, appended into one
//! [`Tree`] with one set of [`Names`] and literal values, and the
//! diagnostics so far.
//!
//! Positions are library-wide: each file's byte offsets are shifted by the
//! file's base, so a [`Span`] alone says which file it's in
//! ([`Library::locate`]). Each node keeps an origin link to the parse node
//! it came from, also shifted, so the files' parse results stay usable for
//! formatting and the language server.
