//! Java's spelling of the 65 operators on builtin types, indexed by
//! [`Op`] (notes/tmpl/nodes.md, "Ops, and core as declarations").
//!
//! As Kotlin's Java backend spells them (its `JavaSupportNetwork.kt`),
//! where that's right: `Int32` and `Int64` are `int` and `long`, whose
//! arithmetic wraps and whose shifts mask their count, as Temper's do, so
//! they're Java's own operators, but for division and remainder, which
//! call `Core.divIntInt` and `Core.modIntInt` to bubble on a zero divisor;
//! three-way comparisons are `Integer.compare` and its kin, and a
//! string's `compareTo`; string equality is `equals`; `Float64.pow` is
//! `Math.pow`; and `Float64` comparisons go through `Double.compare`,
//! which orders NaN and signed zeros as Temper does. Two differences from
//! Kotlin's: `Float64.eq` is `Double.compare(a, b) == 0`, where Kotlin's
//! compares `Double.doubleToLongBits`, which is the same; and `Boolean`
//! comparisons go through `Boolean.compare`, since Java has no `<` on
//! booleans. And string comparisons call a helper that orders code
//! points, as Temper does ([`COMPARE_CODE_POINTS`]), where Kotlin's call
//! `compareTo`, which orders UTF-16 code units, so a character above
//! U+FFFF sorts before one from U+E000 to U+FFFF, and whose `<=>` gives a
//! difference, not -1, 0, or 1.
