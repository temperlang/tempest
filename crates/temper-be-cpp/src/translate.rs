//! The translation from tmpl to C++'s output tree, for subset A, with
//! several modules, imports, and tests, and subset B's classes and
//! interfaces ([`classes`]), nullable types, and `orelse`.
//!
//! **Nullables,** as Kotlin's: a class's or interface's `shared_ptr` may
//! be null itself, and another type `T?` is the runtime's
//! `core::NullableParam<T>`. A null check is `x == nullptr` (which
//! `NullableParam` defines too), a value known not to be null is `x.value`
//! (or the pointer itself), and `==` with a side that may be null is
//! `NullableParam`'s `==`, which compares as Temper's does, where the
//! type's own `==` is C++'s. `as` from `T?` checks, bubbling on null
//! (`core::not_null`, or `checked_cast` for a class).
//!
//! **Bubbling** is the runtime's `TemperBubble` exception: `bubble()` is
//! `core::bubble()`, and `orelse` is `try`/`catch`, each side giving its
//! value where the `orelse`'s goes (returned, assigned, or dropped). An
//! `orelse` or a `BlockValue` (`??`) inside an expression puts its
//! statements before the statement it's in, those before it that do
//! anything computed first; where nothing may run first (the right of
//! `&&`, a branch of `?:`, a loop's condition), it's a lambda called at
//! once. `panic()` is `core::panic()`, which stops the program: Kotlin's
//! turns `f() orelse panic()` into a bubble rethrown, which an `orelse`
//! further out would catch.
//!
//! A module is a namespace, the library's (Kotlin puts every module of a
//! library in it), with its `.cpp` and its header. Its header includes
//! the headers of the modules it imports, the library's own and other
//! libraries' (`<other/helpers.hpp>`), and its init function first calls
//! theirs, each running once. Another module's declarations of the
//! library are named as they are, in the same namespace; another
//! library's, with its namespace (`other::twice`, std's
//! `temper_std::Test`). A `var` of another module's is read where it is,
//! without its module's lock: tmpl reads one only where an import copies
//! it, in the init function, which the header's note allows.
//!
//! **Tests** are functions of the module's, `void NAME(std::shared_ptr<
//! temper_std::Test> const &test)`, as Kotlin's, but only where
//! `TEMPER_TESTS` is defined: at the end of the `.cpp`, after an include
//! of what only they import (std's `testing`), and declared in the header,
//! so the library builds and runs without std, which tmpl doesn't
//! translate yet, and a test build ([`crate::test_main`]) has them. Functions are
//! functions, `static` unless exported, which the header declares; the
//! init block is the body of the module's init function,
//! `global_init_init()`, declared first in the header, which runs it
//! once, through the runtime's `init_once`, as Kotlin's (#636): threads
//! that call it at once wait for one run, and a call from the init
//! itself, as its calls of exported functions make, returns at once. Module
//! `let`s and `var`s that functions use, or that are exported, are
//! storage, as Kotlin's, `core::GlobalSlot`s in a namespace,
//! `temper_globals`, `static` unless exported, which the header declares
//! `extern`; static fields are too, in their class's `struct
//! temper_statics`. The init constructs them first, then runs the
//! modules it imports, then the top level, which sets them; the
//! library's code reads them there (`temper_globals::x.value`), and users
//! through accessors, `x()` and `Type::x()`, which give `const &`s. The
//! rest of the module's `let`s and `var`s are the init's locals. Entry
//! points run the init first, where it does anything: exported functions
//! and accessors, and public constructors and static functions of
//! exported classes and interfaces, as Kotlin's.
//!
//! **Module `var`s that functions write** are shared between threads, so
//! functions read and write them only under the module's lock, a
//! `std::mutex`, where Kotlin's are plain variables, a data race (which
//! C++ leaves undefined) when two threads call such functions at once. A
//! run of statements that read or write them and call nothing
//! ([`calls_nothing`]) runs under one lock, a `std::lock_guard` to the
//! end of its block (`ticks = ticks + 1`, or `bump`'s two updates and its
//! `return`), so concurrent updates are never lost; elsewhere a read is
//! `load(x)`, which takes the lock to copy the value, and a store of a
//! value that calls something is `store(x, value)`, computed first and
//! stored under the lock, since a call could take the lock again. Such an
//! exported `var`'s accessor gives a copy, through `load`, where Kotlin's
//! gives a `const &` that the functions' writes race with. The init
//! function needs no lock: it runs once, and entry points wait for it.
//!
//! **Order of evaluation:** C++ leaves the order of a call's arguments,
//! of a receiver and its method's arguments, and of most operators'
//! operands, unspecified (g++ often goes right to left), where Temper's
//! is left to right. Where the order would show ([`Effects`]: one
//! operand writes module state or a field, or logs, and another
//! writes too, reads what may be written, or may bubble), each operand
//! before the last such one is computed first into a local named by
//! [`naming::hints`] (`int32_t int32 = bump();`), in order. Kotlin's C++
//! (at the vendored commit) leaves the order to the compiler, so
//! `module-state`'s `report()` logs `hi 1 of 3 10` under g++.
//!
//! **Objects** are `std::shared_ptr`s; a parameter of one is a `const &`,
//! as Kotlin's, which the caller's temporary outlives, since C++ keeps a
//! temporary to the end of its full expression: so calls chain on
//! objects that calls return (`r->scaled(2)->scaled(3)`), and nothing
//! holds a reference into one past its statement. What a reference can
//! outlive is a field: an argument read from a `var` field, or through
//! one (`self->box->item`), is copied to a named local first, since the
//! callee could assign the field and free what the reference shows, and
//! a member keeps its own object (`self`) where it could drop the last
//! other `shared_ptr` to it ([`classes`]). Where Kotlin passes the field
//! itself, `this_->replace(this_->box)` sees the new box, not the one it
//! was given.
//!
//! C++ has no labeled loops: a `break` or `continue` of a loop that isn't
//! the innermost is a `goto` to a label after the loop or at the end of
//! its body, outside a block holding the body, so the jump never skips a
//! local's initialization. A self-assignment (`zero = zero`) is left out:
//! it does nothing.
