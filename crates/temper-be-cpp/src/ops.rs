//! C++'s spelling of the 69 operators on builtin types, indexed by [`Op`]
//! (notes/tmpl/nodes.md, "Ops, and core as declarations").
//!
//! As Kotlin's C++ backend spells them (its `CppSupportNetwork.kt`),
//! where that's right: `Int32` and `Int64` arithmetic goes through the
//! runtime's `Int` and `Int64` helpers (`core::Int::add`), which wrap as
//! Temper's does rather than overflow, which C++ leaves undefined, and
//! division and remainder through `div_wrap` and `mod_wrap`, which bubble
//! on a zero divisor and give `INT32_MIN / -1` without C++'s undefined
//! behavior, or by a divisor that can't fail them, `div_safe` and
//! `mod_safe`; comparisons, bitwise operators, and `Float64`'s arithmetic
//! are C++'s own; `Float64`'s comparisons go through the runtime's
//! `Float64::lt` and the like, which order NaN and signed zeros as Temper
//! does; three-way comparisons through `Compare::cmp` and
//! `Float64::cmp`, which give -1, 0, or 1. Strings compare with C++'s own
//! operators, which compare `std::string`'s bytes as `unsigned char`, so
//! UTF-8 orders by code point, as Temper does.
//!
//! Differences from Kotlin's: shifts go through the runtime's `Int::shl`
//! and `Int::shr`, which mask the count, as Temper does, where Kotlin's
//! `a << b` is undefined for a negative `a` or a count past 31 (`>>` with
//! a count from 0 to 31 is C++'s own); and the translator writes C++'s
//! own `/` and `%` where the divisor is a literal other than 0 and -1, so
//! neither the zero check nor the overflow can apply.
