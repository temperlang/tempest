//! The C++ backend on Kotlin Temper's functional tests that tmpl's
//! translation covers so far, from the vendored copy
//! (`temper-funtests`), with the class tests (`kit::CLASSES`) and those
//! with nullables and `orelse` (`kit::NULLABLES`), and those with
//! core's other types and members (`kit::CORE_TYPES`: string indices,
//! `StringBuilder`, `Empty`, `Deque`, `DenseBitVector`, and more of
//! `String`'s and `Float64`'s), and those with host code
//! (`kit::CONNECTED`, each as is and under `--no-connected`), those of
//! divisions that can't fail and maps (`kit::DIVISIONS`), those of
//! labeled loops' jumps and classes declared in functions
//! (`kit::LOOPS_AND_CLASSES`), those of generators, `async`, and `await`,
//! as state machines run by the runtime's `async_run` (`kit::ASYNC`), on the
//! shared programs (`crates/temper-be-testkit/programs/`), which cover
//! operators, jumps, module state, string order, nullables, and classes beyond
//! those tests, and on programs of C++'s own: names C++ takes
//! ([`HIDING`]), and objects a call frees while it runs ([`LIFETIMES`]).
//!
//! - `goldens`: each program's generated library, laid out as Kotlin's,
//!   with its `init.cpp` matching the golden in `tests/goldens/`, named
//!   for the test's path (`algos-fibonacci.cpp`), and its header and
//!   `main.cpp` as the test expects; a library of several modules, or
//!   with tests (`modules`, `imports-library`, and `testing`), has every
//!   file in its golden. To accept new or changed output, run with
//!   `UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1` and review the diff.
//! - `runs`: without CMake, `g++` (or `CXX`) compiles every generated
//!   `.cpp` against the vendored runtime (`vendor/temper/be-cpp`), C++14
//!   as Kotlin's, with every warning [`STRICT`] lists an error, through a
//!   precompiled header of the runtime, built once per set of options
//!   and kept under `CARGO_TARGET_TMPDIR` until the runtime, the options,
//!   or `g++` change (when it's built, the runtime is checked with every
//!   warning it tolerates, [`RUNTIME_WARNINGS`]). It links one library's
//!   `main.cpp` as Kotlin's program, and a runner of every library, which
//!   runs a library's init by name, entry points with no init first
//!   ([`FIRST_USE`]), which run it themselves, and `module-state` from 8
//!   threads, which all enter it at once with no init first; each logs
//!   what the test expects of Kotlin's `cpp` backend. Then the same under
//!   AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, and the threads
//!   under ThreadSanitizer (built of `module-state` alone, and with
//!   libcurl, the `netresponse` tests, whose client has a thread of its
//!   own), which catch
//!   the data races and use-after-free that Kotlin's C++ can have (the
//!   class tests and `classes` chain calls on returned objects, and
//!   `lifetimes` frees objects and lists in use). The sanitizers' build
//!   of every library compiles several files to one object
//!   ([`compile_bulk`]), since the plain build has checked each alone;
//!   with `TEMPEST_CPP_BULK=0`, each compiles alone there too
//!   (notes/test-speed.md, "C++'s functional tests in bulk").
//!   `TEMPEST_CXXFLAGS` adds options to every build but ThreadSanitizer's,
//!   as the nightly workflow's sanitized job does. Every library is built in
//!   one directory, so `imports-library` finds `modules` beside it, but
//!   a library with host code, which names it `work`, builds alone, its
//!   host `.cpp`s with C++14 alone, since the test's host code isn't
//!   written for the warnings. Each library with tests builds again with
//!   `TEMPER_TESTS`, with std's `testing` and its `test.cpp`, strictly,
//!   and runs, writing JUnit's XML, its failures compared with its
//!   `expectedFailures` (none but for those that run as tests, `TESTS`,
//!   which run only so). Skipped, with a message,
//!   without `g++`; with `TEMPEST_REQUIRE_CHECKERS` set, as in CI, that
//!   fails it instead.
//! - `net_client_from_host`: `host/net.cpp` plugs a client of its own
//!   into std `net` and runs the `netresponse` tests' libraries, under
//!   the sanitizers. In `runs`, those tests pass where `g++` finds
//!   libcurl's headers ([`curl`]), and otherwise give Kotlin's expected
//!   failures.
//! - `co_await_interop`: `co_await.cpp`, a C++20 coroutine that awaits
//!   Temper promises, built with `-std=c++20` under the sanitizers,
//!   logs as they settle, then range-for loops over a generator, which a
//!   failed step leaves done, and `host/interop.cpp` does the same with
//!   the `async-turns` program's generated library; skipped where `g++`
//!   has no coroutines.
