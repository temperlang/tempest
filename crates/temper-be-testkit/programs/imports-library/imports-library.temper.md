# Imports a library

Imports another library by its name, `modules`, and one of its modules
by its path there; a library's tests import std's `testing` the same way.
And from `renamed`, exports whose names backends' namings change, each
spelled as `renamed`'s own naming spelled it.

    let { sum } = import("modules");
    let { twice, base } = import("modules/helpers");

    export let both(n: Int): Int { sum(n) + twice(n) + base }

    console.log("both ${both(2).toString()}");

    let { lambda, native, Checked, Builtins } = import("renamed");
    let checked = new Checked(lambda(native));
    console.log(
      "renamed ${checked.delete().toString()} ${checked.local.toString()} ${checked.end.toString()}"
    );
    let b = new Builtins(4);
    console.log(
      "builtins ${b.hash.toString()} ${b.get(1).toString()} ${b.set(3).toString()} ${b.map(5).toString()} ${b.format()} ${b.int.toString()} ${b.later().toString()}"
    );
    console.log(b.print());

```log
