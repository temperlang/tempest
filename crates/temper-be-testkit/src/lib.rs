//! What the backends' tests share: the programs they translate, how a
//! program becomes tmpl, goldens, the tools they run, and runtimes
//! cached between runs. Only the backends' tests use it, as a
//! dev-dependency; it knows no backend.
//!
//! - **Programs:** Kotlin Temper's functional tests that tmpl's
//!   translation covers ([`COVERED`]), from [`temper_funtests`]'s
//!   `cases/`, and the shared programs in this crate's `programs/`
//!   ([`PROGRAMS`]), which cover module state, operators, jumps, and
//!   string order beyond those tests, each a [`Case`] with the
//!   log a backend expects ([`cases`]). A backend adds programs of its
//!   own as more [`Case`]s.
//! - **To tmpl:** [`program`] settles a case's library and translates it,
//!   or reads it as tmpl, and validates it, then gives it the case's host
//!   files and whether it runs under `--no-connected` ([`CONNECTED`]).
//! - **Goldens:** [`Goldens`] compares output with the files in a
//!   backend's `tests/goldens/`, and with `UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1` writes new
//!   output there instead.
//! - **Tools:** [`tool`] finds one named by an environment variable or on
//!   `PATH` ([`temper_tmpl::tools`], which backends' own test runners
//!   share, as they share its JUnit XML reading); a missing one skips its test with a message ([`missing`]),
//!   unless `TEMPEST_REQUIRE_CHECKERS` is set, as in CI, when it fails.
//! - **Runtimes:** [`cached`] builds something once under
//!   `CARGO_TARGET_TMPDIR`, keyed by a hash of its inputs, and keeps it
//!   until they change.
//! - **Test server:** [`test_server_port`] starts, once per process, a
//!   local server answering as Kotlin's `TestWebServer`, for std `net`'s
//!   tests ([`NET`]), whose `testServerPort` is its port, any free one,
//!   as Kotlin's suite picks; goldens show it as [`TEST_SERVER_PORT`].
//! - **Runs:** [`check_log`] compares what a program logged with what's
//!   expected, and [`check_case`] also that a run expected to fail does,
//!   and [`threads_expected`] is what `module-state` from 8
//!   threads logs; for a test that runs as tests ([`TESTS`]),
//!   [`check_tests`] compares its failures, as a backend's runner reports
//!   them ([`junit_failures`] for JUnit XML), with its `expectedFailures`.
