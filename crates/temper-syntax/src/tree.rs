//! The tree: nodes in a few flat arrays, addressed by [`NodeId`].
//!
//! The parser builds operator nodes, whose children are operand nodes and
//! the operator's own tokens, like `(Plus (Leaf 1) + (Leaf 2))`. A `Leaf`
//! node holds a run of value tokens: one for `1`, several for `let x`.
//! Children are stored contiguously, so a node's children are a slice.
//! Parse trees are never changed. Later steps rewrite a node in place
//! ([`Tree::replace`]): its new children are appended as a new range, and
//! the old range becomes garbage, freed with the tree.
//!
//! The grammar step ([`ast`](crate::ast)) builds a second tree of the same
//! type from the parse tree, with the node kinds after `Token`: calls,
//! blocks, declarations, functions, names and values.
