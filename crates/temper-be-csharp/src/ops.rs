//! C#'s spelling of the 69 operators on builtin types, indexed by [`Op`]
//! (notes/tmpl/nodes.md, "Ops, and core as declarations").
//!
//! As Kotlin's C# backend spells them (its `CSharpSupportNetwork.kt`),
//! where that's right: `Int32` and `Int64` are `int` and `long`, whose
//! arithmetic wraps (C# is `unchecked` unless a project says otherwise,
//! and Kotlin's `.csproj` doesn't) and whose shifts mask their count, as
//! Temper's do, so they're C#'s own operators, but for division and
//! remainder, which call the runtime's `Core.Div` and `Core.Mod` to bubble
//! on a zero divisor and to give `int.MinValue / -1` without C#'s
//! `OverflowException`, and an unsigned shift, `Core.UShr`, since C# 10
//! has no `>>>`. Three-way comparisons of integers and booleans are
//! `CompareTo`, which gives -1, 0, or 1; `Float64`'s go through the
//! runtime's `Float64.Compare`, which orders NaN and signed zeros as
//! Temper does; and strings' through `StringUtil.CompareStringsByCodePoint`,
//! which orders code points, as Temper does (not UTF-16 units, as
//! `string.CompareOrdinal` would), and gives -1, 0, or 1. String equality
//! is `==`, which is ordinal. Two differences from Kotlin's: `Boolean`
//! comparisons go through `CompareTo`, since C# has no `<` on booleans
//! (Kotlin's turns `CompareTo(…) < 0` into `<`, which doesn't compile),
//! and `Float64.pow` is `Math.Pow`, as Kotlin's.
