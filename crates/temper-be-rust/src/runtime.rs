//! This crate's runtime, `runtime/temper-core`, built in, for
//! `temper.out` beside generated libraries, as Kotlin Temper copies it
//! there. A test in `temper-driver` checks that [`FILES`] lists every file of
//! it that Kotlin copies: not its
//! dotfiles, nor its own tests and tools (JS's `package-lock.json`,
//! Python's `mypyc/`, and Java's `src/test/`). [`VERSION`] says where
//! its files name its version, which `tempest build` fills in (and
//! Lua's rockspec is renamed for it, as Kotlin names it); the sources say
//! `0.0.0`, so the runtime still builds and tests where it is.
