# Inconsistencies

Where Temper's documentation disagrees with itself, with temperlang.dev,
with Temper's first compiler (written in Kotlin), or with tempest, found
while gathering the docs here (2026-11-07). Each is flagged in place
with a `> **Note:**` that links here. Resolve one by fixing the docs,
the compiler, or both; then remove its note and its entry.

Where tempest differs from the Kotlin compiler on purpose, or works
around its bugs, is in
[notes/kotlin-differences.md](../notes/kotlin-differences.md); this
page doesn't repeat those.

## Licensing and community

### I1: The documentation's license

- **Docs:** [COPYRIGHT](../COPYRIGHT), in both repositories, and
  `temper license` say the documentation is CC BY-SA 4.0.
- **Site:** temperlang.dev's footer, from its `mkdocs.yml`, links CC
  BY-NC-SA 4.0 (non-commercial).
- **Suggested:** BY-SA, as COPYRIGHT says; fix the footer. These docs
  follow COPYRIGHT ([NOTICE](../NOTICE)).

### I2: Discord invites

- **Docs:** the Kotlin repository's README and CONTRIBUTING link
  `discord.gg/QQKgZMukVB`, the site's footer `discord.gg/TY3Be6fzwu`,
  and the tour `discord.com/invite/6Jb83cq5FH`.
- **Here:** every page uses the site's, `TY3Be6fzwu`.
- **Suggested:** check which still work, make one permanent, and use it
  everywhere.

### I11: Playground addresses

- **Here:** every link to try Temper (the README, the guide, and
  [tools](tools/playground.md)) goes to tempest's playground, published
  on GitHub Pages with the docs site. `play.temperlang.dev` is left
  only where it's history: the internals' comparison with Temper's
  first playground.
- **Left:** the [playground terms](legal/playground-terms.md) still
  name `playground.temper.systems`, the old site's playground, and the
  Kotlin README still links `play.temperlang.dev`.
- **tempest:** a static page, compiling in the browser, with no server
  and no accounts; sharing puts the code in the URL.
- **Suggested:** terms that fit what it does (a static page may need few
  or none), the Kotlin README's link updated, and one lasting address.

## Languages and versions

### I3: C++ support

- **Docs:** the Kotlin README lists C++ under "Coming soon"; the target
  language list leaves it out; the tour lists six languages.
- **tempest:** C++ passes every functional test, and real libraries'
  tests, under sanitizers.
- **Kotlin:** has a `cpp` backend (not built by default), failing some
  functional tests.
- **Suggested:** list C++ as supported, built with `-b cpp`; done in
  [target languages](backends/README.md) and the tour.

### I4: Backends that tempest doesn't have

- **Docs:** the target language list documents `java8`, `mypyc`, and
  `data`; builtins document `dataFile`, which writes through `data`;
  `temper build` builds `data` by default; the test matrix has `cppv`.
- **tempest:** none of these; `dataFile` isn't declared.
- **Suggested:** decide which matter. Java 8 has users in older JVMs;
  `mypyc` and `cppv` are experiments; `data` needs `dataFile`.

### I5: Node and JavaScript versions

- **Docs:** getting started says Node 14 or later; the 0.x release note
  "Require Node 18 and Python 3.11" says 18; the target language list
  says ES2018.
- **tempest:** CI runs generated JavaScript on Node 24, and checks it
  with the latest TypeScript.
- **Suggested:** state one tested range, such as Node 18 and later, and
  test the oldest in CI.

### I13: Lua versions

- **Docs:** "Supported version: Lua 5.1".
- **tempest:** rockspecs declare `lua >= 5.1`; tests run on Lua 5.4 and
  LuaJIT, not PUC Lua 5.1; a few functional tests need 5.3 or later.
- **Suggested:** say "5.1 and later, tested on 5.4 and LuaJIT", and
  list what needs 5.3.

### I14: Python named arguments

- **Docs:** the Python notes said named arguments translate to Python's,
  but with numeric suffixes still to remove.
- **Both compilers:** named arguments were removed from Temper (see the
  release notes); tempest writes no numbered names.
- **Here:** the note is replaced by how names translate.

### I15: Contributor toolchains

- **Docs:** the Kotlin CONTRIBUTING asks for JDK 21, Java 8 and 17,
  Maven, Lua 5.1 or 5.4, .NET 6, Node 18, Python 3.11, and Rust 1.71.1.
- **tempest:** Rust 1.85.0, uv, and each language's tools to run every
  backend's tests ([contributing](contributing/README.md#testing)).
- **Suggested:** each repository keeps its own list; no change needed
  until the Kotlin repository retires.

## Output and tools

### I6: The `temper.out` layout

- **Docs:** getting started listed `csharp/hello/src/Hello/HelloGlobal.cs`,
  `java/hello/src/main/java/hello/hello/HelloGlobal.java`, and
  `lua/hello/hello.lua`.
- **tempest:** `src/HelloGlobal.cs`, `src/main/java/hello/HelloGlobal.java`,
  and `init.lua`; its layout is tested against the Kotlin compiler's
  current one.
- **Here:** the list shows tempest's paths.

### I7: Rust warnings

- **Docs:** generated Rust "still causes a number of compiler
  warnings", silenced with `--cap-lints=allow`.
- **tempest:** its Rust passes `cargo build` and clippy without
  warnings.
- **Suggested:** drop the advice once tempest's output is what users
  get.

### I8: Numbered names in output samples

- **Docs:** the home page's translations, made by the Kotlin compiler,
  had names like `x__4` and `this__0`.
- **Here:** the [introduction](guide/introduction.md) shows tempest's
  translations, regenerated, with the source's names.

### I9: The command line

- **Docs:** the guide uses `temper init`, `build`, `test`, `watch`,
  `repl` (and its `describe`), `version`, and `help`; the language
  server is `temper serve --port N`.
- **tempest:** `temper`'s commands and flags, as `tempest build`,
  `test`, `run`, `repl`, `init`, `version`, `license`, `licenses`,
  `help`, and `serve` (or `lsp`, on standard input and output only); no
  `watch`, `doc`, or `repl -b` yet, which say so, and the REPL has no
  `describe`, `translate`, or `help` functions yet
  ([the command line](tools/cli.md), [the REPL](tools/repl.md)).
- **Suggested:** finish CLI parity, then decide whether the binary is
  called `temper`.

### I12: The functional test matrix

- **Docs:** the Kotlin repository's `functional-test-matrix.md`,
  generated, shows failures on `cpp`, `cppv`, `lua`, and others.
- **tempest:** all 72 functional tests pass on the interpreter and on
  every backend.
- **Suggested:** not imported here; regenerate it there, or retire it
  when tempest takes over.

## Language and examples

### I10: Examples tempest doesn't run as marked

The reference's examples carry the result the Kotlin compiler gave when
its docs were generated, and `compat/check_doc_examples.py` runs them
with tempest ([writing these docs](contributing/docs.md#examples-that-are-checked)).
These 14 disagree; each was checked on the Kotlin compiler, which runs
them as marked. Each has a `<!-- known: I10 -->` comment before its
fence, so the checker, which runs in CI, counts it as known.

| Where | Example | tempest |
|---|---|---|
| [builtins](language/builtins.md#cat) | `cat("foo", "bar")` | "cat has not been declared" |
| [builtins](language/builtins.md#assignment--builtin) | Assigning a property with only a setter | "No member p in C" |
| [builtins](language/builtins.md#macro-datafile) | `dataFile(…)` | "dataFile has not been declared" (see [I4](#i4-backends-that-tempest-doesnt-have)) |
| [builtins](language/builtins.md#defining-functions) | A named function expression, `fn f(): String { … }` | "Use of builtin fn is malformed" |
| [builtins](language/builtins.md#inlineunrealizedgoal-decorator) | `return` from a block lambda passed to `forEach`, inlined | "Expected subtype of Void, but got Boolean" |
| [builtins](language/builtins.md#json-decorator) (two), [std/json](std/json.md) | `@json` classes' `jsonAdapter()` on the interpreter | "No member jsonAdapter" when run; the backends translate it |
| [builtins](language/builtins.md#private-visibility) | Reading a private member from outside its class | An error when run, not when compiled |
| [builtins](language/builtins.md#builtins-keyword) | Subclassing `Console`; `builtins.console` | "Console has not been declared" |
| [types](language/types.md#float64-syntax-examples) | `1.` is an error | Accepted, as `1` and a dot |
| [builtins](language/builtins.md#assignment--builtin), [`++`](language/builtins.md#-operator-increment), and [`--`](language/builtins.md#---operator-decrement) | Logging a top-level `var` around assignments | See [I20](#i20-top-level-statements-run-out-of-order); both compilers agree |

**Suggested:** fix tempest for each, or record a deliberate difference
in [notes/kotlin-differences.md](../notes/kotlin-differences.md), and
remove its `known` comment and its row here.

### I16: A function expression used as a declaration

- **Docs:** the literate example in [modules](language/modules.md)
  declared `fn greet(…) { … }` and later called `greet("world")`; but
  a function expression's name isn't visible outside it, as
  [builtins](language/builtins.md#fn) explain.
- **Here:** it's `let greet(…)`.

### I17: The tour's date snippets

- **Docs:** the tour's `Person` uses `Date`, without an import, and its
  C#, Java, JavaScript, Lua, and Python snippets construct
  `new Date(1987, 6, 5)` from the library.
- **Both compilers:** `std/temporal`'s `Date` is each language's own
  date type (`DateTime`, `LocalDate`, JavaScript's `Date`, whose months
  count from 0, and `datetime.date`).
- **Suggested:** import `std/temporal` in the Temper code, and use each
  language's date in the snippets.

### I18: `for … of` loops

- **Docs:** tutorial 3 says "for each" looping is future work
  ([issue 20](https://github.com/temperlang/temper/issues/20)).
- **Both compilers:** `for (let x of list) { … }` works, with `break`
  and `continue`, since 0.4.0 (see the release notes).
- **Suggested:** teach `for … of` in tutorial 3.

### I19: Module prefaces and `;;;`

- **Docs:** [modules](language/modules.md) describes a module
  *preface*, module *parameters*, and up to two `;;;` tokens: preface,
  body, then JSON metadata.
- **Both compilers:** one `;;;` separates code from JSON metadata
  after it (tempest follows the Kotlin compiler's
  `splitCodeFromMetadata`); there are no prefaces or parameters
  ([issue 10](https://github.com/temperlang/temper/issues/10)).
- **Suggested:** document `;;;` as it works, and keep prefaces as a plan.

### I20: Top-level statements run out of order

- **Docs:** three [builtins](language/builtins.md#assignment--builtin)
  examples log a top-level `var` before and after assigning it, as
  source order would.
- **Both compilers:** log the value after every assignment, twice,
  since a module's top-level readers of a `var` wait for every
  statement that assigns it; inside a function, they log as shown.
- **Suggested:** settle top-level order, which
  [notes/kotlin-differences.md](../notes/kotlin-differences.md) ("Top-level
  statements in source order") calls broken; until then, move the
  examples into a function.

### I21: `Date.yearsBetween` with the later date first

- **Docs:** `std/temporal`'s doc comment says the result is the floor
  of the range's magnitude, so the order of the dates shouldn't matter.
- **Both compilers' interpreters:** `Date.yearsBetween(2026-03-01,
  2024-02-29)` is `-3`, though the other order gives `2`.
- **Suggested:** fix std to match its comment (and check each backend's
  connected version, such as Java's `ChronoUnit.YEARS.between`), or
  document it as signed.

### I22: Named groups in regular expressions

- **Docs:** std's regex docs write a capture as `/(?<name>...)/` and,
  a few lines later, `/(?name = ...)/`; the tutorial uses `(?name=…)`.
- **Kotlin:** accepts both.
- **tempest:** accepts only `(?name=…)`: `lookaround and (?<name>...)
  aren't supported; use (?name=pattern)`.
- **Suggested:** accept `(?<name>…)` in tempest too, since JavaScript,
  Java, C#, and Python 3.11's `re` (as `(?P<name>…)`) users expect it.

### I23: Integer literals too big for Int32

- **Docs:** four [builtins](language/builtins.md#operator--shift-right)
  examples, `>>`, `>>>`, `^`, and `~`, write 64-bit hex or 32-bit binary
  literals without `i64`, such as `0x8000_0000_0000_0000` and
  `0b1111_0000_…`.
- **Both compilers:** read them as `Int32`, warn that they're out of
  bounds, and wrap them (hex up to `0xFFFF_FFFF` is exempt, as bits;
  binary isn't). The `^` and `~` examples still hold after wrapping; the
  shifts compare wrapped values.
- **Suggested:** decide whether integer literals take their type from
  context; then add `i64`, or write the 32-bit ones in hex, as the
  answer needs.

### I24: Tutorial examples tempest doesn't run

The tutorial's REPL transcripts run as a test
(`crates/temper-frontend/tests/repl_docs.rs`); two of
[control flow](guide/tutorial/03-control-flow.md)'s examples are left
out of it, as tempest rejects them:

- `let areaPerPerimeter = fn (shape: Shape): Float64 { … }`: "needs a
  declared type, such as a @fun interface, since a function literal
  takes its type from the type wanted"
  ([language.md](../notes/language.md), fun interfaces).
- `do(fn () { … while(i < n, fn { … }); })`: "Use of builtin do is
  malformed".

**Suggested:** decide whether tempest should accept them, or show
what it accepts in the tutorial.
