**Temper** lets a developer or a small team solve a problem once, for
every programming language community. It's a language designed for one
purpose: to translate well to all the others. You write a library in
Temper, and get idiomatic, semantically equivalent libraries in each
language, with their tests.

```temper
export let half(x: Int): Int {
  x / 2
}
```

becomes, in Python,

```py
from temper_core import int_div as _int_div

def half(x: int, /) -> int:
    return _int_div(x, 2)
```

and likewise in each of these[\*](#not-endorsed-or-affiliated):

## This repository

This is **tempest**, Temper's compiler written from scratch in Rust
(edition 2024): the same language, behavior, and generated APIs as
Temper's first compiler, from a much smaller, simpler, and faster
code base. It's one small binary, `tempest`, and it also runs in the
browser.

- **The whole pipeline works:** parsing, the settle loop (names,
  macros, and types), an interpreter, tmpl (the backend IR), and seven
  backends.
- **Temper's functional tests** all pass on the interpreter and on
  every backend, and the generated code passes each language's strict
  checkers (clippy, `tsc --strict`, pyright and mypy, LuaLS, and
  compilers with warnings as errors).
- **Real libraries** (Hrefine, Chromarite, Ordable, Kelpto, and
  Wherewith) pass all their tests in all seven languages.
- **Editors:** a language server, `tempest lsp`, and a VS Code
  extension ([editors/vscode](editors/vscode/README.md)).
- **Coming:** the rest of the `temper` command line
  ([docs/tools/cli.md](docs/tools/cli.md)).

## Try it

- **In your browser:** the
  [playground](https://temperlang.github.io/tempest/c9cb414b4800a065953f72df4ab69943/playground/)
  runs the whole compiler as wasm: type Temper and see every
  language's output, errors, and test results as you type.
- **From source,** with [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) 1.85 or later:

      cargo build --release -p tempest
      target/release/tempest test DIR        # run a library's tests
      target/release/tempest build -w DIR    # write temper.out/LANGUAGE/…

  A library is a directory with a `config.temper.md`; the
  [getting started guide](docs/guide/getting-started.md) makes one.
  Temper's standard library is built in, so the binary needs nothing
  beside it.
