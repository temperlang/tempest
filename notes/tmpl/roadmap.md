# tmpl: design roadmap

Part of the [tmpl design](README.md).

## Design roadmap

Each level unlocks code, so design and building interleave.

| Level | State | Unlocks |
|---|---|---|
| 1: purpose and decisions | Done, reviewed (2026-10-29) | The crate boundary and its rules; nothing to build alone |
| 2: structure | This draft (2026-10-29) | The `temper-tmpl` crate skeleton: schema macro, node families, type and declaration tables, builder, the text writer and reader with a round trip, and the validator's structural rules, all tested on hand-written tmpl |
| 3: details, in subsets | Next | Per subset: exact fields, validator rules, and passes, then the frontend's translation (`to_tmpl`) for the functional tests that subset covers, then backends |

Level 3 goes subset by subset, each just ahead of the code that needs
it (Proposed):

- **Subset A:** functions, locals, `if`, `while`, returns, calls, the
  builtin types' operators and members, `console.log`, and module init.
  Then `to_tmpl` for the functional tests that use only these, then the
  naming pass, the shared output tree, and the Python backend running
  them, as its Kotlin-compatible variant first ([question 22](open-questions.md)).
- **Subset B:** classes, properties, equality, object literals,
  bubbling and `orelse`, `for … of`, closures, and imports. Python grows
  to most functional tests, with its API diff (milestone 5).
- **Subset C, Rust:** the results lowering, cells for assigned
  captures, properties as methods, first-use init, and synchronized
  module `var`s. Then the Rust backend (milestone 6).
- **Subset D:** generators and `async`, with the state-machine pass
  for Rust; then the other backends' profiles.

**Interleaving with milestone 4** (Proposed). Milestone 4's remaining
critical path ([milestone-4.md](../milestone-4.md), "Order and
decisions") runs in alternating chunks with tmpl's, since `to_tmpl`
needs every expression of a test typed:

| Chunk | Milestone 4 | tmpl |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `new Box()`, `[]`, `null`, `bubble()`, and `panic()` taking the type wanted; `Never<T>` | Crate skeleton, schema macro, type and declaration tables |
| 2 | Builtin interfaces' members inherited by users' classes; a literal's result binding a generic callee's type parameter | Text writer, reader, and round trip; structural validator |
| 3 | Slice 7 begins: count expressions of unknown type; resolve every `==` ([nodes.md, "Equality"](nodes.md#equality)) | Level 3 for subset A |
| 4 | Slice 7 continues, driven by which functional tests still have unknown types | `to_tmpl` for subset A's tests |
| 5 | Slice 7 continues | Naming pass and Python backend for subset A |
| then | Kotlin's diagnostics, where cheap | Subsets B, C, and D |

A test whose expressions aren't all typed is reported by `to_tmpl` and
skipped, so the count of translated functional tests tracks slice 7.
No reference cycles (slice 8) follows tmpl, as decided.
