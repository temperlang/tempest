# tmpl: open questions

Part of the [tmpl design](README.md).

## Open questions, with recommendations

**Decided (2026-10-29), second round:** the user accepted the
recommendations below, with these adjustments:

- **Protocols:** track only the common operators and traits that Kotlin
  Temper already lets code control (`@operator("==")`,
  `@operator("<=>")`) or that Temper's features and usage strongly
  imply (`toString` as `Show`, `for … of` iteration). More will come,
  but don't add `Protocol` variants or table rows ahead of the language
  (questions 32 and 33).
- **Identity** is a placeholder: Temper hasn't defined how code asks for
  it, so `Identical` stays in the model, and its spelling waits for the
  language (question 12).
- **Source maps:** make them work correctly for JS in browsers first
  (standard source maps, UTF-16 columns), and test them in JS engines
  as the proof of concept. Kotlin Temper emits them for every backend;
  other backends may get forms more practical for them later (question
  34).

Answered on 2026-10-29 and folded into the topic files: profile shape, canonical
text syntax and type elision, `for … of`, surface facts stored, where
immutability facts come from (revised: `@imu` and `@partialImu` plus
analysis), and init order; also backend variants and pretty names
everywhere. Still open from Level 1:

1. **Schema mechanism:** `macro_rules!` or a `build.rs` generator?
   Recommend `macro_rules!` until it hurts.
2. **Captures in the tree or computed?** Recommend in the tree, checked
   by recomputation, so passes and text show them.
3. **Ownership facts** for Rust, Swift, and C (clones, last uses):
   stored or computed? Recommend computed ([analyses.md](analyses.md)) until a backend proves
   otherwise.
4. **Bubbling payloads:** reserve a value on failure now? Recommend
   reserving the field, unused until Temper decides.
5. **Builtin keys:** one namespace for builtins, operators, and
   connected members, listed in the crate so backends' tables are
   checked for completeness? Superseded (2026-10-29) by questions 36
   to 43: operators are a closed set, and connected declarations are
   keyed by qname or resolved by name.
6. **Statements inside expressions** at the high level? Recommend yes,
   with a statement-izing pass; Rust keeps them.
7. **Spans:** file id and byte range, with line and column computed
   only for source maps? Recommend yes.
8. **Generics for C-like targets:** erasure or monomorphizing? Defer;
   keep full generics in the model.
9. **The tmpl interpreter** for compile-time evaluation of cached
   dependencies? Recommend deciding with the cache, after milestone 6.
10. **Surface choices in profiles:** one struct with body and surface
    sections? Recommend yes, so a backend's whole stance is in one
    place.
11. **What may cross an isolate?** Defer until an isolation model
    exists.

New from Level 2. The user approved the recommendations marked
Decided below on 2026-10-29:

12. **Identity's spelling in Temper.** Temper has none today: `===` and
    `!==` lex as operators, but nothing gives them a meaning, and the
    docs don't mention identity. Recommend a core function,
    `identical(a, b)` (Dart's name), allowed only on class and
    interface types, with `===` left unused. It's explicit, greppable,
    and one typo away from nothing, where `===` is one character from
    `==` and means something else in JS. A language change for the
    team; tmpl's `Identical` node doesn't depend on the spelling.
    **Decided (2026-10-29):** `Identical` stays as a placeholder; how
    Temper code asks for identity isn't defined yet, so its spelling
    waits for the language.
13. **`==` without an operator method:** on a generic `T`, `AnyValue`,
    a function value, or an interface without one. Recommend an error
    in all these, never a silent identity check; a bound such as `T
    extends Equatable` calls the bound's method. **Decided
    (2026-10-29):** an error, once a scan of std and the libraries
    finds what relies on identity fallback today (milestone 4, slice 7).
14. **Host equality protocols:** should a class's `@operator("==")`
    method also implement Python's `__eq__`, Rust's `PartialEq`, and
    C++'s `operator==`? Recommend yes for those three; for Java and C#,
    keep a plain `eq` method until Temper has hashing, since `equals`
    without a matching `hashCode` breaks hash maps. **Decided
    (2026-10-29)** as recommended ([surface.md](surface.md), Level 3).
15. **Null-safe `==` between nullable values:** one wrapper node,
    expanded by a pass, or expanded by the frontend as Kotlin's
    `EqMacro` does? Recommend the wrapper (`EqNullable`): Python and
    Rust compare nullable values natively, and the expansion is long.
    **Decided (2026-10-29):** `EqNullable`.
16. **Comparisons:** `<` on builtin types as per-type keys (`Int64.lt`)
    or as `<=>` then `< 0`, as Kotlin now desugars? Recommend per-type
    keys, since every primary target has them natively; classes' `<`
    stays `compareTo(…) < 0`, which a backend may resugar.
17. **Fixed-type nodes in text:** may text also leave out types that a
    node's kind fixes (`Boolean` for `&&`, null checks, and
    `Identical`)? Recommend yes, as a fourth local rule; it's as
    trivial as a literal's. **Decided (2026-10-29):** yes.
18. **References in text:** `name#id` everywhere, or `#id` after the
    definition? Recommend `name#id` everywhere, the name checked by the
    reader, so text reads and diffs well.
19. **Init order through calls:** an initializer that reads a later
    module value directly is an error; through a function it calls?
    Recommend a warning from the reaches-module-state analysis, since
    it can't be exact.
20. **Rust's `async`:** native `async fn` over Temper's `Promise`, or
    the state machine as for generators? Recommend native, as
    ../history/milestone-3.md's `Future` plan suggests; generators get the state
    machine.
21. **Where `@imu` is checked:** tempest's frontend doesn't check it
    yet. Recommend the frontend reports violations in Kotlin's words (a
    small milestone 4 item, near slice 8, which needs the same facts),
    and the tmpl validator rechecks them as an invariant. **Decided
    (2026-10-29)** as recommended.
22. **The first Python variant:** Kotlin-compatible or idiomatic?
    Recommend Kotlin-compatible first, so milestone 5's API diff
    against Kotlin is empty by design and existing users can switch;
    the idiomatic variant follows as profile, naming, and surface data,
    with its own API baseline. **Decided (2026-10-29),** widened:
    every backend's first variant is Kotlin-compatible, so Chromarite's
    and Ordable's tours keep working.
23. **Natural alternatives before numbers:** in what order? Recommend
    the hint's own candidates, then a name shared with a local whose
    lifetime doesn't overlap (where the target's scoping allows), then
    the shortest suffix (`x2`), and a golden-test count of suffixed
    names across the functional tests, std, Chromarite, and Ordable,
    kept near zero. **Decided (2026-10-29)** as recommended.

Questions 16, 18, 19, and 20 weren't in the list approved on
2026-10-29, so their recommendations stay Proposed until confirmed.
Questions 1 to 11 also stay open.

New from Level 3 (subset A), all Proposed:

24. **Declaration ids through passes:** keep each `DeclId`, append
    new ones, and leave tombstones, or renumber in writing order?
    Recommend keeping them, so lowered text differs from starting text
    only where a pass changed it.
25. **A fifth local type rule:** `IfValue`, `BlockValue`, and later
    `OrElse` take their value's type, which T3 already makes equal.
    Recommend yes; most written `(e): T` would go.
26. **Scalar builtin types as fixed type entries,** not external
    declarations? Recommend yes; generic builtin types stay
    declarations.
27. **`Error`'s type:** the type its place wants, rather than `Never`
    of it? Recommend yes; it avoids a `FromNever` around every error,
    and backends treat it the same.
28. **`GetModuleLet` and `SetModuleLet`** for every module `let`, the
    declaration saying `var`, in place of Level 2's `GetModuleVar`?
    Recommend yes.
29. **Every loop declares a label,** compiler-made if the source has
    none? Recommend yes, so jumps always name their target.
30. **Python's `Void`:** a value natively, as `None`, unlike Level 2's
    profile table? Recommend yes.
31. **A debug form for `toString`'s protocol:** derive `Debug` and
    `__repr__` per backend, or a source-level hook? Recommend deriving
    now, and asking the team about a hook later.
32. **More `@operator` protocols** (`[]` for `get` and `set`,
    iteration, hashing): which, and how they're spelled, is for the
    team; tmpl only needs a `Protocol` variant and table rows.
33. **`toString` as `Show`:** by its well-known name and signature, or
    by an explicit mark? Recommend by name, since Kotlin's backends
    rely on the name already.
34. **Source map columns:** UTF-16 units, converted with stored text
    of non-ASCII lines only? Recommend yes. Built so (2026-10-30;
    nodes.md, "Source positions").
35. **Bubbling in module init:** a may-bubble call in an init block,
    with no handler, fails the module's initialization. Check against
    Kotlin Temper's behavior before `to_tmpl` relies on it.

**Decided (2026-10-29), third round,** on qnames and connected
declarations (folded into [names.md](names.md#level-3-qnames),
[nodes.md](nodes.md#level-3-ops-and-core-as-declarations), and
[overview.md](overview.md#core-decisions)):

- tmpl has a place for qnames, which may follow Kotlin's.
- Connected is one concept from outside; inside, custom translation or
  lowering is chosen by qname. Std may later use user space's
  mechanism; core likely keeps specialized tree rewriting.
- Customization is general, by naming, and only for operators and
  connected declarations, never a hardcoded table of core functions.
- User-space connected declarations resolve by name, as Kotlin's do:
  host code defines the name the translation gives. Only core's and
  std's are keyed by qname.

New with that round, all Proposed:

36. **Qname format:** Kotlin's exactly, core written `core` and std
    `std`? Recommend yes, so Kotlin's connection tables port verbatim
    and api-compat can match declarations across Kotlin and tempest
    builds.
37. **Qnames stored or derived:** recommend derived from owners,
    names, and kinds, with a stored override only where Kotlin's
    differs (disambiguation indexes, a `let` holding a function
    literal); text writes only overrides.
    Built as recommended (2026-10-29).
38. **What stays built in:** a closed set of 65 operators on builtin
    types, or operators as connected core declarations too? Recommend
    the closed set: Kotlin has no declarations for `+` and the rest,
    and passes and analyses should match operators by enum. Core's
    other 48 members become declarations.
    Built as recommended (2026-10-29): `ops.rs` has the 65.
39. **Renaming `Builtin` to `Op`** (and `builtins.rs` to `ops.rs`)?
    Recommend yes, as its own commit before the migration, so the
    migration's diff stays readable.
    Done (2026-10-29), as its own step.
40. **Recording how a connected declaration resolves:** **Decided
    (2026-10-29):** not stored. `connected` is a flag, and how it
    resolves is recognized from the declaration's library (core and std
    by qname, user code by name) by one shared helper.
41. **A user-code connected declaration with a body:** **Decided
    (2026-10-29):** the same connected fallback as the design proposed
    for Kotlin Temper: an optional list of backends with host code
    (`@connected(["cpp", "rust"])`); listed backends call host code,
    and unlisted backends and the interpreter use the body. With no
    list, every backend needs host code, as today.
42. **`console`:** a compiler-made module `let` initialized by core's
    `getConsole()`, as Kotlin's frontend does, rather than a special
    form? Recommend yes; Kotlin's backends give each module its own
    logger through it.
    Built as recommended (2026-10-29), in tmpl's goldens; the frontend
    makes `~console` with `to_tmpl`.
43. **Pulling into subset A** the pieces core's declarations need:
    external declarations with `uses`, non-generic `Nominal` types,
    `CallMethod`, and `Omitted` with optional parameters? Recommend
    yes, as one chunk, before `to_tmpl`, so `to_tmpl` never emits the
    48 keys.
    Built as recommended (2026-10-29).
44. **Failure kinds beyond `Bubble`** (raised by the user, 2026-10-29,
    as team brainstorming): Temper may get custom exception types, but
    can't guarantee their payload (a message at best, delivered on a
    best-effort basis to each backend's world) or any particular
    hierarchy. Recommend leaving room without depending on it: the
    bubble effect and `Bubble`-raising nodes may later carry an
    optional failure kind (a nominal declaration, by qname) and an
    optional message, absent by default and never relied on by passes
    or by what Temper code can observe portably; backends map a kind
    to a native exception class or error variant where they can, and
    ignore it where they can't. Until the language decides, `Bubble`
    stays the only failure, and nothing in subset A's layout should
    rule this out.
45. **Where `x++` as a statement simplifies:** the frontend's macro
    expands `x++` to `do { let t = x; x = t + 1; t }`, since expansion
    can't know whether the value is used; `to_tmpl` drops the
    temporary when it isn't. **Decided (2026-11-03):** keep it so. A
    backend that wants `i += 1` or `i++` for readability resugars in
    its printer, never the frontend.
46. **Other libraries' names:** a reference to another library's
    declaration spells the name that library's own naming gave it
    (its `NameMap`, from the same build or the library cache), never
    one derived again from the qname, so conflict renames, connected
    names, `temper.keep`, and any later naming override carry over.
    **Decided (2026-11-03).** Test it with an export the dependency's
    naming changed (for a target keyword, say) and a connected name,
    used from a dependent library. Temper has no per-backend naming
    decorators yet.
47. **One library per program:** each library is its own tmpl program,
    translated on its own, as each becomes its own package in each
    language; its dependencies come in only as interfaces (exports,
    types, and chosen names), the same whether built from source in
    the same run or read from the library cache
    ([library-cache.md](../library-cache.md)). **Decided
    (2026-11-03).** A whole-program mode (for apps that bundle
    everything, say) may come later as an optimization, but never
    decides names or meaning.
48. **Backends are pluggable:** neither the frontend nor tmpl lists or
    counts backends, nor says which backends connect what. tmpl marks a
    std member connected by its key (its qname, Kotlin's support-network
    key) and keeps its Temper body when it has one; each backend owns
    its connection table, connecting the std keys its table has, and
    translating the body for the rest, with a clear "not yet" if there's
    neither. Adding a backend is adding a crate with its own table;
    nothing upstream changes. **Decided (2026-11-03, by the user).**
49. **Test-only module values:** a module `let` read only by tests is,
    in Kotlin's backends, computed in production too (Python and JS at
    import; Rust, after a Kotlin fix, as a static initialized in the
    module's init), so production pays for test data and runs whatever
    computes it. Recommend a test-only init section: tmpl marks
    declarations reachable only from tests, and each backend puts them
    where only tests build or load them (Rust statics under
    `#[cfg(test)]`, test modules elsewhere), keeping init order for
    everything production runs. Proposed (2026-11-03; the user agreed
    tempest should).
50. **Sanitizers in `tempest test`:** on by default, as a
    backend-neutral test option (`--no-sanitize` turns it off; a
    library's config may too) that each backend interprets as it sees
    fit, since backends are pluggable. Today only C++ uses it: ASan and
    UBSan (`-fsanitize=address,undefined` for GCC and Clang,
    `/fsanitize=address` for MSVC, which has no UBSan), leak checks off
    (generated code's `shared_ptr` cycles leak by design; a separate
    opt-in pass), ThreadSanitizer opt-in only (it needs its own build
    and settings; tempest's CI keeps running it). Where a sanitizer
    isn't available, warn once and run without it. A C99 backend, or
    any later one, may use the same option. `tempest run` and
    benchmarks never sanitize. The C++ compiler comes from `CXX`, else
    the platform's usual one (g++ or Clang on Linux, Clang on macOS,
    MSVC on Windows), with flags to match the compiler's family,
    found by probing it (its version banner), not by its name. So
    Clang or MinGW g++ on Windows work too when `CXX` names them:
    `clang-cl` takes MSVC-style flags, `clang++` GCC-style ones (with
    ASan and some UBSan on Windows), and MinGW g++ has no sanitizers
    on Windows, so it warns once and runs without. Without `CXX`,
    Windows prefers `cl` when a Visual Studio environment is set up,
    else `clang++`, else `g++`. **Decided (2026-11-04, by the
    user);** built with the Windows and MSVC testing chunk
    ([testing.md](testing.md), "Every backend on every platform").
51. **Fixes to Kotlin's runtimes and std:** tempest may fix bugs in the
    runtimes and std it began with from Kotlin Temper when the fix keeps
    behavior (first: the JS runtime's wrong JSDoc types, so generated
    code needs no casts). **Decided (2026-11-04, by the user);** kept
    as patches re-applied on each sync until 2026-11-12, when the
    copies became tempest's own and syncing ended; the 22 changes are
    listed in
    [06-backends.md](../../docs/internals/detail/06-backends.md#changes-from-kotlin-tempers-runtimes).
