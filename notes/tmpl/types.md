# tmpl: types

Part of the [tmpl design](README.md).

## Level 1: Types

Proposed; Level 2, below, has the structure. Nominal types with arguments,
invariant type parameters (typing.md), nullable types, `Void`,
`Never<T>`, and function types that carry their `@fun` interface's name
(Decided, design.md "Function types and fun interfaces"). Bubbling is an
effect on a function type, not a type; Kotlin's `Result<T, Bubble>` is
one backend's lowering. Classes are final; only interfaces are
extended, and they may carry method bodies.

## Level 2: The type model

The `TypeTable` interns every type, so equal types have equal ids. Its
variants:

- `Nominal { decl, args }`: classes, interfaces (`@fun` ones too), and
  builtin types, which are external declarations from core, linked by
  qname (`Int32`, `String`, `List`, `Map`, `Generator`, `Promise`, …).
- `TypeParam(decl)`, with its bounds on the declaration.
- `Nullable(T)`, never of a nullable `T`.
- `Function { params, optional, result, bubbles }`: bare function
  types, kept while tests use them; Decided to go in favor of named
  `@fun` interfaces.
- `Void`, `Never(T)` (bottom with its fallback type), and `AnyValue`
  (the top).
- `Result(T)`: only in programs lowered to results ([nodes.md](nodes.md)).

Relationships, all answered by `analysis` helpers rather than stored
twice: supertypes from each declaration's `extends` with arguments
substituted; subtyping (nominal, invariant arguments, `Nullable` and
`Never` rules); a member's type as seen from a receiver type; and a
`@fun` interface's signature.

Invariants: no inference variables or unknown types (an `Error` node
is typed `Never` of what its place wants); explicit type arguments on
every generic call and `New`; every type an export mentions is
exported or external.

Per-backend type spelling (Java's boxing, Rust's `Option` and `Arc`,
C#'s nullable value types) is the translator's, never a pass's.

## Level 3: Types for subset A

Proposed.

```rust
pub struct TypeId(u32);           // TypeId::NONE (u32::MAX) for statements
pub struct TypeTable {
    data: Vec<TypeData>,          // interned: equal types, equal ids
    lists: Vec<TypeId>,           // TypeListId ranges, for arguments and parameters
}
pub enum TypeData {
    Scalar(Scalar),               // ids 0 to 6, the same in every program
    Function { params: TypeListId, result: TypeId, bubbles: bool },
    // Subset B: Nominal, TypeParam, Nullable, Never; subset C: Result.
}
pub enum Scalar { Void, Boolean, Int32, Int64, Float64, String, AnyValue }
```

- **Scalar builtin types are fixed entries,** not external
  declarations as Level 2 had them: every program has them, they need
  no link key, and text writes them bare (`Int32`, not `Int32#7`).
  Generic builtin types (`List`, `Map`, …) stay external declarations,
  linked by qname, since they have type parameters and members to link
  ([question 26](open-questions.md)).
- **Temper's `Int` is `Int32`,** in text and everywhere else.
- **A function declaration's type is its signature,** a `Function`
  entry: parameter types, result, and whether it may bubble. This
  stays when bare function types go away, since it's only how
  signatures are stored.
- **Subtyping in subset A is equality;** with no classes or nullable
  types, a child fits its role only by having the role's type.
- **Operators have fixed signatures,** in the crate's operator table
  ([analyses.md](analyses.md#level-3-analyses-for-subset-a)), so an
  `Op`'s type comes from its operator. Core's class for a scalar type
  (`core.type Int32`) is still an external declaration, owning its
  members ([nodes.md](nodes.md#level-3-ops-and-core-as-declarations)).

As built (2026-10-29, Proposed), with core's declarations:

- **`Nominal { decl }`,** without type arguments yet: an interned entry
  per class or interface, which is also its declaration's type. Core's
  class for a scalar has the scalar as its type instead, so a
  receiver's type is its method's owner's either way.
- **Signatures say which parameters are optional** (`Signature`'s
  `optional`, kept beside the parameter types), so a call checks
  `Omitted` against its callee's signature alone, external callees
  included, which have no parameter declarations. A parameter
  declaration's `OPTIONAL` fact must agree (T1).
- **Subtyping is still equality:** an interface's implementers come
  with subset B's classes.

As built with nullable types (2026-10-30, Proposed):

- **`Nullable(T)`,** interned once per `T` (`TypeTable::nullable`, which
  gives `T?` back for a nullable `T`, and `is_nullable`, `non_null`, and
  `nullable_of`). Subtyping stays explicit: `T` goes where `T?` is
  wanted only through `AsNullable`, and `T?` where `T` is wanted only
  through `NonNull` or `As` ([nodes.md](nodes.md)).

As built with generics (2026-10-31, Proposed):

- **`Nominal { decl, args }`:** a class's or interface's type with its
  type arguments, interned by both; a generic one's own type is it
  applied to its type parameters (`Box#4<T#5>`), and text always writes
  the arguments. `TypeParam { decl }` is a type parameter, declared
  (`DeclKind::TypeParam`) and owned by its generic function, method,
  class, or interface, which lists them in order
  (`DeclTable::type_params`); a type parameter's supertypes are its
  bounds.
- **Calls carry their type arguments** (`TypeArgs`, interned lists, in a
  call's `b` slot). A call's type, a field read's, and its arguments'
  expected types are the declaration's with the type parameters put in,
  from the type arguments and from the receiver's type seen as the
  member's owner (`analysis::bindings`, `analysis::as_super`), so the
  local rules still give every type.
- **Subtyping:** a class's or interface's type is a supertype's through
  its declared supertypes with type arguments put in (invariant
  arguments); a type parameter is what its bounds are. A receiver of a
  generic owner's member may be any subtype of the owner (`List<T>` for
  `Listed.isEmpty`), with no `Upcast`, unlike a non-generic owner's.
- **Core's generic types** (`Listed`, `List`, `ListBuilder`, `Pair`,
  `MapKey`, `Mapped`, `Map`, and `MapBuilder`) are external
  declarations in the core fixture, with their members that take no
  function types; `ListLit` makes a `List` of core's.


**Function values (As built, 2026-10-31, Proposed):**

- **A `@fun` interface is a `Nominal` type** of an interface marked
  `FUN` (text `fun interface`), whose one member is its abstract `apply`
  method: strictly nominal, as the frontend decided (design.md,
  "Function types and fun interfaces"). Its values are functions; the
  signature they have is `apply`'s with the interface's type arguments
  put in (`analysis::fun_signature`, `Builder::fun_signature`, which
  interns it; `Builder::finish` interns every `@fun` interface type's,
  so analyses and backends find each without interning).
- **A bare function type is a `Function` entry,** as a declaration's
  signature is, now also a value's type: a parameter's, a local's, a
  field's, a literal's. Core's members that take functions (`map`,
  `filter`, `join`, `sorted`, `reduce`, `reduceFrom`, `ListBuilder.sort`,
  `Mapped.forEach`) take them, as core.temper declares.
- **No implicit conversions between them:** `ToFun` takes a function
  type's value to a `@fun` interface of the same signature, `FromFun`
  the reverse; a literal or reference takes the type its place wants
  instead (`Builder::retype`). Every backend so far writes both as one
  type, so the conversions write nothing (Java adapts by a method
  reference where the interfaces differ).

**Parameters' defaults (As built, 2026-11-01, Proposed):** a parameter
of the program's own with a default is optional and typed `T?`, in its
declaration and its signature alike, since null means its default
([nodes.md](nodes.md), "Subset B's next step: parameters' defaults");
callers pass `T` through `AsNullable`. A function type keeps that too,
as a reference to such a function has it (`fn (Int32, _?: Int32?):
String`). Core's members keep their fixture's types (`toString(radix?:
Int32)`), whose connections apply their defaults.

**Core's other types (As built, 2026-11-02, Proposed):** a builtin type
that isn't one of tmpl's scalars is `Nominal` of core's declaration in
the core fixture: `StringIndex` and `NoStringIndex`, classes under the
sealed interface `StringIndexOption`; `StringBuilder`; `Empty`;
`DenseBitVector`; and `Deque<T>`, as `List<T>` is. Backends write each
as Kotlin's do: string indices as integers in most languages and
`usize`, `Option<usize>`, and `()` in Rust, a builder as the language's
own, and `Empty` as its unit ([nodes.md](nodes.md), "Subset B's next
step: core's other types"; [profiles.md](profiles.md), "As built, core's
other types").
