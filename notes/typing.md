# Typing and flow facts

Part of the [rewrite plan](README.md).

Typing works in two layers that cooperate inside the settle loop:

1. **Declared and inferred types** of declarations and expressions, as
   constraints solved when their inputs are known (see the settle loop in
   [design.md](design.md)).
2. **Flow facts**: what's known at each *use* of a variable, such as "not null
   here", "is a `Circle` here", or "between 0 and 255 here". These come from
   structured passes over a function body, with no control-flow graph.

## Flow facts without a CFG

Temper's settled tree has structured control flow: blocks, `if`, loops,
labeled `break`/`continue`, `return`, and failure (`bubble` with `orelse`).
So a pass can walk a function body in evaluation order and carry an
*environment* of facts, merging at the points where control flow merges,
instead of first building a graph.

The environment maps each local to what's known about it:

- **Type:** narrowed by `is`, casts and null checks.
- **Nullability:** null, not null, or either.
- **Value range,** for numbers: a constant, an interval like `0..=255`, or
  unknown. For strings and lists, possibly emptiness or length bounds.
- **Definitely assigned**, or not.

How each construct is handled:

- **Sequence:** facts flow through statements in order.
- **`if (c) A else B`:** the condition refines facts separately for each
  branch (`a != null` makes `a` non-null in `A` and null in `B`); after the
  `if`, merge the two outgoing environments. A branch that always exits
  (`return`, `throw`, `break`) contributes nothing to the merge, which is what
  makes the early-return pattern work:

  ```temper
  if (a == null) { return x; }
  a.length   // `a` is non-null here
  ```

  Kotlin Temper rejects this today; this design handles it naturally.
- **Loops:** iterate the body until the environment at the loop head stops
  changing. To guarantee that quickly, ranges *widen* after a couple of rounds
  (an interval that keeps growing becomes unknown in that direction).
- **`break` and `continue`:** carry their environment to the loop or label
  they target; that target merges everything that arrives.
- **`return` and failure:** carry their environment to the function exit,
  or to the nearest `orelse`, which merges whatever can fail inside it.
- **Closures:** a local that a closure might assign loses its narrowed facts
  wherever the closure might run. Locals no closure assigns keep them.

The cost is about linear in the function's size, plus a few rounds for loops.

### Why "semi-holistic"

Each function body is analyzed as a whole once its inputs have settled (the
types of the things it calls and reads), rather than fact by fact. If an
input changes later in the settle loop, which is rare, the function's facts
are recomputed. Results go into side tables keyed by node id, so the tree
itself doesn't change.

## What flow facts are used for

- **Typing:** the type of each use of a local, so null checks and `is` checks
  narrow the way people expect.
- **Errors:** null access, use before assignment, unreachable code, and casts
  that can never succeed, all with precise spans.
- **Generated code quality:** skipping runtime checks that facts prove
  unnecessary. The big one is integer overflow: Python and Lua route every
  `Int` operation through helper functions to emulate 32-bit wraparound, and
  ranges can show that most loop counters and indexes can't overflow, so they
  can use plain `+`. Also bounds checks and null checks in other languages.
- **Constant folding** where values are known.

## Inference of declarations

- **Locals without annotations** take the type of their initializer, widened
  to a declared supertype only if later assignments need it.
- **Generic calls** solve their type arguments from argument types and the
  expected result type at that call site. The solver is small: unify, collect
  bounds, pick the most specific type that satisfies them.
- **Function signatures** come from annotations, which Temper requires at
  module boundaries, so libraries typecheck independently.

## Checking semantics and messages

The type checker's behavior and its error messages should match Kotlin
Temper's wherever practical. Sources to compare against: the frontend stage
tests, the backend tests, the REPL tests, and running Kotlin Temper itself,
including its REPL, on the same inputs. See
[testing-and-milestones.md](testing-and-milestones.md).
